Coding Exercise

We've added an array of cars to our garage. All of the vehicles are out for the day, and we need to update the array. 
Now that you've seen getters and setters, use a setter to update the cars array to reflect all cars being gone. 
Then, in the get_cars variable, get the cars data from the home object.

class Garage:
  def __init__(self, size):
    self.size = size
    self.cars = ["Ram", "Model 3"]

  def open_door(self):
    return "The door opens"
    
home = Garage(2)
# End of starter code

# Setter goes here

get_cars = # Getter goes here
